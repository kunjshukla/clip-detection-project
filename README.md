# 🧠 CLIP-Based Human & Animal Detection System

This project leverages OpenAI’s CLIP model to **detect and classify humans and animals** from **images, videos, or datasets** with bounding box visualization. It supports real-time testing and accuracy evaluation on custom datasets.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Human & Animal classification using CLIP (ViT-B/32)
- ✅ Supports 13 categories: `human`, `cow`, `goat`, `lion`, `dog`, `cat`, `horse`, `bird`, `elephant`, `monkey`, `butterfly`, `frog`, `snake`
- ✅ Works on:
  - Static images
  - Videos (frame-by-frame)
  - Batch dataset directory
- ✅ Test accuracy on labeled dataset

│
├── main.py                  # Main script (code provided above)
├── dataset_images/          # Folder for running batch image detection
├── archive(4)/test_dataset/ # Organized dataset with class-wise folders for testing accuracy
└── animal2.mp4              # (Optional) Video file for testing
```

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- CLIP (`openai/CLIP`)
- PIL (Pillow)
- numpy

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python pillow numpy ftfy regex tqdm
```

---

## 🔍 How to Use

### 1. Detect on Image Folder
```python
process_dataset("dataset_images/")
```

### 2. Detect on Video
```python
process_video("animal2.mp4")
```

### 3. Test Accuracy on Dataset
Ensure test dataset is structured like:
```
test_dataset/
  ├── cat/
  ├── dog/
  ├── elephant/
  └── ...
```

Run:
```python
test_accuracy_on_dataset("archive(4)/test_dataset/")
```

---

## 📈 Accuracy

The system uses simulated bounding boxes and CLIP for classification. For better accuracy (target: **≥ 85%**), ensure:
- Clean, centered images
- Proper labeling
- Diverse samples in test set
