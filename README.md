# CLIP-Based Human & Animal Detection System

This project leverages OpenAI’s CLIP model to **detect and classify humans and animals** from **images, videos, or datasets** with bounding box visualization. It supports real-time testing and accuracy evaluation on custom datasets.

---

## Features

- Human & Animal classification using CLIP (ViT-B/32)
- Supports 13 categories: `human`, `cow`, `goat`, `lion`, `dog`, `cat`, `horse`, `bird`, `elephant`, `monkey`, `butterfly`, `frog`, `snake`
- Works on:
  - Static images
  - Videos (frame-by-frame)
  - Batch dataset directory
- Test accuracy on labeled dataset

---



## Approach

    Image & Video Input:
        Accepts single images, entire datasets, or video files.
        Simulates bounding box detection (placeholder), but works on the full image for classification.

    CLIP Model Usage:
        Converts predefined text labels into text embeddings using clip.tokenize().
        Processes image crops (or full images) using CLIP’s visual encoder.
        Compares image embeddings to text embeddings using cosine similarity.
        Picks the most likely label using argmax on the similarity scores.

    Accuracy Evaluation:
        The test dataset is organized by folders, each representing a class.
        Each image is classified, and the predicted label is compared with the actual folder name.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- CLIP (`openai/CLIP`)
- PIL (Pillow)
- numpy

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python pillow numpy ftfy regex tqdm
```

## 🔍 How to Use

### 1. Detect on Image Folder
```python
process_dataset("dataset_images/")
```

### 2. Detect on Video
```python
process_video("animal2.mp4")
```

### 3. Test Accuracy on Dataset
Ensure test dataset is structured like:
```
test_dataset/
  ├── cat/
  ├── dog/
  ├── elephant/
  └── ...
```

Run:
```python
test_accuracy_on_dataset("archive(4)/test_dataset/")
```

---

## 📈 Accuracy

The system uses simulated bounding boxes and CLIP for classification. For better accuracy (target: **≥ 85%**), ensure:
- Clean, centered images
- Proper labeling
- Diverse samples in test set
